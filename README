DIRECTORIES
-------------
boinc/partproject - contains the client program that performs calculations
boinc/sched - contains the assimilator and work generator on the server side
scripts - common scripts that are used for various purposes throughout the project
result - the header file to read and use results and example programs illustrating 
           it's use.
server - files used in some way for setting up your project server and
            creating work units.



PREREQUISITES (for building software to use the results)
--------------
On Unix-y systems:
 * Pretty much any version of GCC.

On Windows systems:
 * Pretty much any version of Visual C++/Visual Studio

PREREQUISITES (for building client and building and running server)
--------------

All operating systems require the following software installed
   * A 1.8 compliant ruby interpreter (must be able to call via 'ruby')

Other prerequisites vary by operating system
Prerequisites in order build and run PartProject will differ based on 
your operating system.

For Unix/Linux:
(As described at http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/SoftwarePrereqsUnix)
   * Subversion (svn)
   * GNU Tools:
      * make 3.79+
      * m4 1.4+
      * libtool 1.5+
      * autoconf 2.58+
      * automake 1.8+
      * GCC 3.0.4+
      * g++
   * pkg-config 0.15+
   * Python 2.2+ with MySQLdb module 0.9.2+ and XML module
   * MySQL 4.0.9 or higher (include the client and lib/dev package)
   * Apache with mod_ssl and PHP5+
   * PHP5 with cli, db and mysql support
   * OpenSSL 0.9.8+
   * libstdc++.a

Most of these can be easily retrieved through your distribution's package
management system.

NOTE: The client program is only barely tested on Linux. It works when 
running from the command line but I can't certify anything beyond that.

For Windows:
Prerequisites are downloaded pre-built by calling 'setup.rb win_depends'
In order to build the client program, Visual Studio 2005 is required.
Later versions may work but you will need a different version of
the dependencies.
   
HOW TO BUILD PARTPROJECT (once you have prerequisites)
--------------
First call 'ruby setup.rb checkout'. This will checkout BOINC and Boost
which are needed to compile PartProject.

If you're on Unix-y systems:
Next call 'ruby setup.rb setup_and_make'. This builds Boost, BOINC and
PartProject. You're done!

If you're on Windows:
Next call 'ruby setup.rb win_depends'. This gets all the Windows
dependencies. 

Open the BOINC.sln file in boinc/win_build in Visual Studio 2005. Build
the libboinc_staticcrt and libboincapi_staticcrt projects.

Finally open the partproject.vcproj file in boinc/partproject in Visual
Studio 2005. Build the partproject project. NOTE: This only compiles the
BOINC client application, not the server side components. These do not
compile on Windows.

I WANT TO USE THE RESULTS
--------------
Make sure you have the prerequisites in 
"PREREQUISITES (for building software based on the results)"

In the results subdirectory, see the README file.
