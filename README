Copy the file PartProject.h from your


PREREQUISITES (for building software based on the results)
--------------
On Unix-y systems:
 * Pretty much any version of GCC.

On Windows systems:
 * Pretty much any version of Visual C++/Visual Studio

PREREQUISITES (for building client and building and running server)
--------------

All operating systems require the following software installed
   * A 1.8 compliant ruby interpreter (must be able to call via ruby)

Other prerequisites vary by operating system
Prerequisites in order build and runPartProject will differ based on 
your operating system.

For Unix/Linux:
(As described at http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/SoftwarePrereqsUnix)
   * Subversion (svn)
   * GNU Tools:
      * make 3.79+
      * m4 1.4+
      * libtool 1.5+
      * autoconf 2.58+
      * automake 1.8+

   * OpenSSL 0.9.8+
   * libstdc++.a

Most of these can be easily retrieved through your distribution's package
management system.

For Windows:
Prerequisites are downloaded pre-built by calling 'setup.rb win_depends'
In order to build the client program, Visual Studio 2005 is required.
Later versions may work but you will need a different version of
the dependencies.
